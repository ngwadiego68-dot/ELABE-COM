Sulphur is an element of period III, group VI of the periodic table with electronic configution 2:8:6 .Sulphur is extracted from the underground deposit by the <font color="green">frasch process</font><br><br>
<u><b>process</b></u>
<ul>
<li>A hole about 30cm in diameter is drilled through the soil layer to the sulphur bed</li>
<li>A sulphur pump made up of three concentric steel pipe is sunk down in to the hole to the sulphur bed</li>
<li>Superheated water at a temperature oF at a teperature of abuot 170Â°C and under a pressure of about 10atm is forced through the outermost pipe.This is to melt the sulphur and also maintains the sulphur in the liquid state</li><br>

<li>Hot compressed air at a pressure of 15atm is then blown through the innermost down the sulpur bed to force out the sulpur</li>
<b><u>NOTE I:</b></u>The sulphur is prevented from solidifying by the temperature of superheated water<br>
<li>The molten sulphur is continously pumped to the surface where it is allow to cool and solidify in large tanks 
<li>The sulphur is separated from sulpur water emulsion by <b>DECANTATION</b></li>
<p><p>The sulphur obtained is 99% PURE</P>
