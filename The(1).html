Definition <font color = "black", , color= "3"> :It is the physical, chemical break down of complex,insoluble, undigestible food particles such as carbohydrate, protein and lipid to simpler, soluble and digestible food particles such as glucose by the action of teeth and enzyme. </font> <br> <br>
<u>types of digestion <br> </u>
Two types of digestion <br> 
<font color = "blue "> Physical digestion </font> <font color = "black "> :It is the chewing action of the teeth </font>. <br>
<font color = "blue "> Chemical digestion </font> <font color = "bl"> It is the action of enzymes on food. <br>
<font color = "black "> <p>In humans digestion takes place in to 4 different stages namely the: mouth, stomach , small intestine (deudenum,) and the large intestine. This is more detailed below; </p> </font>
<ul>
<li><b> <u>Digestion in the mouth </u> </b></li>
The food is ingested in the mouth, it is masticated by the teeth. Salivary gland contains the mucus <FONT color="RED"> saliva </font> and the enzyme <font color="RED"> salivary amylase </font> .Saliva moisten the food and salivary amylase breakdown starch into maltase. The tongue rape the food particles into bolus which is sent in to the stomach via the oesophagus. Finally the epiglopttis block the larynx to prevent food from entering in to the windpipe
<li><b> <u>Digestion in the stomach </u> </b></li>
The presence of food in the stomach stimulate the stomach walls to secret the <FONT color="RED"> hormone gastrin </font> in to blood.  Gastrin cause the <FONT color="RED"> gastric gland </font> to secret <FONT color="RED"> gastric juice </font> , gastric juice is made up of <FONT color="RED"> mucus hydrochloric acid </font> , the inactive enzymes <FONT color="RED"> pepsinogen </font> and <FONT color="RED"> prorenin </font> .One food in the stomach muscles begin wave-like contraction known as <FONT color="RED"> churning </font> and the semi-liquid that results from the churning is called <FONT color="RED"> chyme </font> which lubricate the stomach walls during the passage of food. <br>Pepsin break down proteins into proteose and peptones. <br>
Renin is an enzyme in young mammals stomach. It coagulate soluble milk into caesin
