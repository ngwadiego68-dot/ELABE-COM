    <h1>23.1 The Extraction of Iron (Fe)</h1>
   
    <h2>Physical Properties and Occurrence</h2>
   
    <h3>Properties of Iron</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Iron is highly magnetic.</li>
        <li>It is malleable and ductile.</li>
        <li>Pure iron is relatively soft but becomes hard and strong when alloyed (e.g., in steel).</li>
        <li>It readily rusts (corrodes) in the presence of air and moisture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Occurrence</h3>
    <p>Iron does not occur free in nature. It is the second most abundant metal found in the Earth's crust (after Aluminium).</p>
    <p>Iron is extracted by chemical reduction from its main ores:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Haematite (Fe2O3)</li>
        <li>Magnetite (Fe3O4)</li>
        <li>Iron(III) carbonate (FeCO3)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Extraction Process (The Blast Furnace)</h2>
    <p>The extraction of iron is carried out in a huge structure called the Blast Furnace, which is lined with fire-bricks. The process is a continuous operation.</p>
   
    <div class="diagram">

        </figure>
    </div>
   
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <p>The ore (Haematite), coke (fuel and reducing agent), and limestone (flux) are continuously fed into the top of the furnace.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heating and Reducing Agent Generation: The coke is first roasted to remove water. Hot air is blown into the furnace through openings called tuyeres. Coke reacts with this air to act as a fuel and a reducing agent, producing Carbon Monoxide (CO).</li>
        <div class="equation-box">
            C(s) + O2(g)<font size="5">→</font> CO2(g)
            CO2(g) + C(s)<font size="5">→</font> 2CO(g) (Reduction Agent)
        </div>

        <li>Reduction of Iron Oxide: The iron(III) oxide fe2O3 is reduced by the Carbon Monoxide gas. Most of the reduction happens in the hottest part (lower section) of the furnace.</li>
        <div class="equation-box">
            Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g)<font size="5">→</font> 2Fe(l) + 3CO2(g)
        </div>

        <li>Slag Formation (Impurity Removal): The Limestone (CaCO3) undergoes thermal decomposition to form Calcium Oxide (CaO). The CaO acts as the flux, reacting with the acidic impurity, Silicon Dioxide (SiO2), to form molten Slag (Calcium Silicate, CaSiO3).</li>
        <div class="equation-box">
            CaCO3(s)<font size="5">→</font>CaO(s) + CO2(g)
            CaO(s) + SiO2(s)<font size="5">→</font> CaSiO3(l)(Slag)
        </div>
    </ol>
   
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>The molten iron (pig iron) and molten slag collect at the bottom of the furnace. Since the slag is less dense, it floats on the molten iron and is tapped off separately.</p>
        <p>The iron obtained from the blast furnace is called Pig Iron and is impure, hard, and brittle.</p>
    </div>
   
    <h2>Uses and Importance of Iron</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pig Iron / Cast Iron: Melted and mixed with scrap steel to form Cast Iron, used for making stoves and light machinery.</li>
        <li>Steel: The most important use is to make steel (an alloy of iron and carbon), which is used for cutlery, electromagnets, and armour plate.</li>
        <li>Construction: Used as a hard core in the construction of roads and bridges because it is hard and strong.</li>
        <li>Slag: The byproduct, Slag, is used in the manufacture of light building material, cement, phosphate fertilizers, and road building materials.</li>
    </ul>
