<ul>
<li>The numerous stomata at the lower epidermis provide the passage for <B>CARBON DIOXIDE</B> and <b>oxygen</b> in to and out of the leaf respectively during photosynthesis</li><br>
<li>The xylem vessels conduct water to the leaves</li><br>
<li>The phloem vessels conduct, manufactured food (glucose) from the leaf to other part of the plant giving room for more storage of manufactured food</li><br>
<li>The pallisade cells, which are cylindrical and arranged at right angle close to each other maximize the absorbtion of sunlight</li><br>
<li>The transparent cuticle permit light to pass to the mesophyll cells</li><br>
<li>The pallisade cells in the mesophyll contain more, well positioned chloroplast to receive light</li><br>
<li>The waxy cuticle on the top most part of the leaf protects and prevent desication due to excessive water lost</li><br>
<li>The thin nature of leaves provide a short route for easy diffusion of carbon dioxide</li><br>
<li>The leaves have brought flat surface area to absorb carbon dioxide and sunlight</li><br>
<li>The large extra-cellular air space in the spongy mesophyll layer gives route for the easy circulation of gases</li><br>
