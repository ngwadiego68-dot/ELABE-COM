Rate of chemical reaction is the number of moles of rectants converted or product formed per unit time<br>
<b><u>factors affecting the rate of chemical reaction</u></b><br>
<ol>
<li><b>TEMPERATURE</li></b>
<p>An increase in temperature lead to an increase in the rate of reaction while a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction. This is because an increase in temperature at constant volume will to an inccreace in kinetic energy of the particles making the particles to move faster rapidly colliding with each other.The reaction goes faster because the energy release is greater than the activation energy barrier.</p>
2SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2SO3(g)<br><br>
<li><b>concentration</li><b>
<p>An increase in concentration of reactants will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction while a decrease will lead to a decrease in rate of reaction. This because an increase in concentration result to more particles colliding together.</p><br>
<b><li>LIGHT</LI></B>
<P>An increase in light intensity will lead to an increase in rate of reaction,while a decrease in light intensity will lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction. This because an increase in light intensuty result to kinetic energy energy making the particles to move faster rapidly colliding with each other. </p><br>
<b><li><mark> SURFACE AREA</B><LI>
<P>An increase in the surface area by grinding a lump of solid into powder will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction0 This is because in surface area result to more particles crowding a small volume which result in more partcles colliding effectively to break bonds.</p>
CaCO3 + 2HCl →CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O<br><br>
<b><li> CATALYST</b></li>
<p>A  catalyst is a substance that increase the speed of a chemical reaction but is not consume by the reaction.The presence of catalyst make reactants able to react.<br>EXAMPLE:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) →2NH3(g).The catalyst here is <b><FONT color="red">IRON</FONT></u>
