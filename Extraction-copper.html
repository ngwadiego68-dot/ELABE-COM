    <h1>23.3 The Extraction of Copper (Cu)</h1>
   
    <h2>Physical Properties and Occurrence</h2>
   
    <h3>Properties of Copper</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Copper is highly ductile and malleable.</li>
        <li>It is an excellent conductor of electricity and heat.</li>
        <li>It is resistant to corrosion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Occurrence</h3>
    <p>Copper is one of the less reactive metals and is sometimes found in the free metallic state, but mostly occurs in the combined state as ores, occupying the lower position in the reactivity series.</p>
    <p>The principal source of copper is the sulphide ore Copper Pyrite (CuFeS2). Other ores include Cuprite (Cu2O), Malachite (CuCO3:CaOH)2), and Chalcocite (Cu2(S).</p>

    <h2>The Extraction Process (Thermal Reduction)</h2>
    <p>Copper is extracted from its sulphide ores (like Copper Pyrite) using thermal reduction in a limited supply of air.</p>
   
    <h3>Stage 1: Roasting and Smelting (Initial Reduction)</h3>
    <p>The ore is purified by flotation and then partially burned in a limited supply of air to form Copper(I) Sulphide (Cu2S) and Iron(II) Oxide (FeO).</p>
    <p>Silica (SiO) is added to the mixture to form slag with the Iron(II) Oxide impurity, which is removed.</p>
    <div class="equation-box">
        
    </div>

    <h3>Stage 2: Auto-Reduction (Final Reduction)</h3>
    <p>Copper(I) Oxide (Cu2O) is produced in the mixture, and this oxide reacts with the remaining Copper(I) Sulphide (Cu2S) to be converted into metallic copper by auto-reduction.</p>
    <div class="equation-box">
       Cu2O}(s) + Cu2S(s)<font size="5">â†’</font>   6Cu(s) + SO2(g)
    </div>
    <p>The copper obtained at this stage is impure and is known as blistered copper (because of the Sulphur Dioxide bubbles).</p>
   
    <h3>Stage 3: Purification (Electrolysis)</h3>
    <p>Blistered copper is purified by electrolytic refining to obtain 99.9% pure copper.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>The electrolytic cell is set up as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anode (cu+): Impure Copper</li>
            <li>Cathode (cu-): Pure Copper</li>
            <li>Electrolyte: Copper(II) Sulphate (CuSO4) solution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During electrolysis, copper dissolves from the impure anode and deposits as pure copper on the cathode.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Uses and Importance of Copper</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Electrical Wiring: Used extensively in electrical wiring and transmission lines due to its excellent conductivity. </li>
        <li>Pipes and Plumbing: Used in water pipes due to its corrosion resistance.</li>
        <li>Alloys: Used to make valuable alloys like brass (Copper and Zinc) and bronze (Copper and Tin).</li>
    </ul>
